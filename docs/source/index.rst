The python files that served as a starting point for the development of this library were originally developed by the St. Lawrence Global Observatory (OGSL) for a specific project funded by the `Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada <https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/>`_.

Elements of the development was support by `NOAA's Integreated Ocean Observing System <https://ioos.noaa.gov/>`_, and the `Ocean Tracking Network <https://oceantrackingnetwork.org/>`_.
